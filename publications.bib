	abstract = {Minimizing energy consumption to maximize network lifetime is one of the crucial concerns in designing wireless sensor network routing protocols. Cluster-based protocols have shown promising energyeﬃciency performance, where sensor nodes take turns to act as cluster heads ({CHs}), which carry out higher-level data routing and relaying. In such case the energy consumption is more evenly distributed for all the nodes. However, most cluster-based protocols improve energy-eﬃciency at the cost of transmission delay. In this paper, we propose an improved delay-aware and energy-eﬃcient clustered protocol called Hamilton Energy-Eﬃcient Routing Protocol ({HEER}). {HEER} forms clusters in the network initialization phase and links members in each cluster on a Hamilton Path, constructed using a greedy algorithm, for data transmission purpose. No cluster reformation is required and the members on the path will take turns to become cluster head. The design allows {HEER} to save on network administration energy and also balance the load comparing to traditional cluster-based protocols. The algorithms designed in {HEER} also means that it does not suffer long delay and does not require each node to have global location information comparing with classic chain-based protocols such as {PEGASIS} and its variations. We implemented the {HEER} protocol in {MATLAB} simulation and compared it with several cluster-based and chain-based protocols. We found that {HEER} is able to achieve an improved network lifetime over the current protocols while maintaining the average data transmission delay. In the simulation, {HEER} achieved 66.5\% and 40.6\% more rounds than {LEACH} and {LEACH}-{EE}, which are cluster-based protocols. When compared with chain-based protocols ({PEGASIS} and Intra-grid-{PEGSIS}), {HEER} managed 21.2 times and 16.7 times more rounds than {PEGASIS} and Intra-grid-{PEGASIS} respectively. In addition, {HEER} can eliminated 90\% of transmission delay comparing to {LEACH} and {LEACH}-{EE} and 99\% comparing with {PEGASIS} and Intra-{gridPEGASIS}.},

	abstract = {A good level of situation awareness is critical for vehicle lane change decision making. In this paper, a {DataDriven} Situation Awareness ({DDSA}) algorithm is proposed for vehicle environment perception and projection using machine learning algorithms in conjunction with the concept of multiple models. Firstly, unsupervised learning (i.e., Fuzzy C-Mean Clustering ({FCM})) is drawn to categorize the drivers’ states into different clusters using three key features (i.e., velocity, relative velocity and distance) extracted from Intelligent Driver Model ({IDM}). Statistical analysis is conducted on each cluster to derive the acceleration distribution, resulting in different driving models. Secondly, supervised learning classiﬁcation technique (i.e., Fuzzy k-{NN}) is applied to obtain the model/cluster of a given driving scenario. Using the derived model with the associated acceleration distribution, Kalman ﬁlter/prediction is applied to obtain vehicle states and their projection. The publicly available {NGSIM} dataset is used to validate the proposed {DDSA} algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed {DDSA} algorithm obtains better ﬁltering and projection accuracy in comparison with the Kalman ﬁlter without clustering.},

	abstract = {Hyperspectral images ({HSI}) provide rich information which may not be captured by other sensing technologies and therefore gradually ﬁnd a wide range of applications. However, they also generate a large amount of irrelevant or redundant data for a speciﬁc task. This causes a number of issues including signiﬁcantly increased computation time, complexity and scale of prediction models mapping the data to semantics (e.g., classiﬁcation), and the need of a large amount of labelled data for training. Particularly, it is generally difﬁcult and expensive for experts to acquire sufﬁcient training samples in many applications. This paper addresses these issues by exploring a number of classical dimension reduction algorithms in machine learning communities for {HSI} classiﬁcation. To reduce the size of training dataset, feature selection (e.g., mutual information, minimal redundancy maximal relevance) and feature extraction (e.g., Principal Component Analysis ({PCA}), Kernel {PCA}) are adopted to augment a baseline classiﬁcation method, Support Vector Machine ({SVM}). The proposed algorithms are evaluated using a real {HSI} dataset. It is shown that {PCA} yields the most promising performance in reducing the number of features or spectral bands. It is observed that while signiﬁcantly reducing the computational complexity, the proposed method can achieve better classiﬁcation results over the classic {SVM} on a small training dataset, which makes it suitable for real-time applications or when only limited training data are available. Furthermore, it can also achieve performances similar to the classic {SVM} on large datasets but with much less computing time.},

This paper develops a personalized driver intention prediction system at unsignalized T intersections by seamlessly integrating clustering and classiﬁcation. Polynomial regression mixture ({PRM}) clustering and Akaike’s information criterion are applied to individual drivers trajectories for learning in-depth driving behaviors. Then, various classiﬁers are evaluated to link low-level vehicle states to high-level driving behaviors. {CART} classiﬁer with Bayesian optimization excels others in accuracy and computation. The proposed system is validated by a real-world driving dataset. Comparative experimental results indicate that {PRM} clustering can discover more in-depth driving behaviors than manually deﬁned maneuver due to its ﬁne ability in accounting for both spatial and temporal information; the proposed framework integrating {PRM} clustering and {CART} classiﬁcation provides promising intention prediction performance and is adaptive to different drivers.},

	abstract = {Reliable driving state recognition (e.g. normal, drowsy, and aggressive) plays a significant role in improving road safety, driving experience and fuel efficiency. It lays the foundation for a number of advanced functions such as driver safety monitoring systems and adaptive driving assistance systems. In these applications, state recognition accuracy is of paramount importance to guarantee user acceptance. This paper is mainly focused on developing a personalized driving state recognition system by learning from non-intrusive, easily accessible vehicle related measurements and its validation using real-world driving data. Compared to conventional approaches, this paper first highlights the necessities of adopting a personalized system by analysing feature distribution of individual driver’s data and all drivers’ data via advanced data visualization and statistical analysis. If significant differences are identified, a dedicated personalized model is learnt to predict the driver’s driving state. Spearman distance is also drawn to evaluate the differences between individual driver’s data and all drivers’ data in a quantitative manner. In addition, five categories of classifiers are tested and compared to identify a suitable one for classification, where random forest with Bayesian parameter optimization outperforms others and therefore is adopted in this paper. A recently collected dataset from real-world driving experiments is adopted to evaluate the proposed system. Comparative experimental results indicate that the personalized learning system with road information significantly outperforms conventional approaches without considering personalized characteristics or road information, where the overall accuracy increases from 81.3\% to 91.6\%. It is believed that the newly developed personalized learning system can find a wide range of applications where diverse behaviours exist.},

As a result, they either do not work or lead to a limited performance for new drivers without labeled data. To this end, we develop clustering-aided approaches exploiting group characteristics of the existing drivers’ data. Two clustering aided predictors are proposed. The ﬁrst is clustering-aided regression ({CAR}) model, where the regression model for the cluster with the highest likelihood is adopted. The second is clusteringaided multiple model regression model, where the concept of multiple models is further augmented to {CAR}.
