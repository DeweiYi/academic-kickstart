abstract: "Agriculture is facing severe challenges from crop stresses, threatening its sustainable development and food security. This work exploits aerial visual perception for yellow rust disease monitoring, which seamlessly integrates state-of-the-art techniques and algorithms including UAV sensing, multispectral imaging, vegetation segmentation and deep learning U-Net. A ﬁeld experiment is designed by infecting winter wheat with yellow rust inoculum, on top of which multispectral aerial images are captured by DJI Matrice 100 equipped with RedEdge camera. After image calibration and stitching, multispectral orthomosaic is labelled for system evaluation by inspecting highresolution RGB images taken by Parrot Anaﬁ Drone. The merits of the developed framework drawing spectral-spatial information concurrently are demonstrated by showing improved performance over purely spectral based classiﬁer by the classical random forest algorithm. Moreover, various network input band combinations are tested including three RGB bands and ﬁve selected spectral vegetation indices by Sequential Forward Selection strategy of Wrapper algorithm."
