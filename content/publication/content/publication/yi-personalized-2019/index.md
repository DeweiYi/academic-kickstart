abstract: "Adapting in-vehicle systems (e.g., advanced driver assistance systems and in-vehicle information systems) to individual drivers’ workload can enhance both safety and convenience. To make this possible, it is a prerequisite to infer driver workload so that adaptive aiding can be provided to the driver at the right time and in an appropriate manner. Rather than developing an average model for all drivers, a personalized driver workload inference (PDWI) system considering individual drivers driving characteristics is developed using machine learning techniques via easily accessed vehicle related measurements (VRMs). The proposed PDWI system comprises two stages. In ofﬂine training, individual drivers workload is ﬁrst automatically splitted into different categories according to its inherent data characteristics using fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering. Then an implicit mapping between VRMs and different levels of workload is constructed via classiﬁcation algorithms. In online implementation, VRMs samples are classiﬁed into different clusters, consequently driver workload type can be successfully inferred. A recently collected dataset from real-world naturalistic driving experiments is drawn to validate the proposed PDWI system. Comparative experimental results indicate that the proposed framework integrating FCM clustering and support vector machine classiﬁer provides a promising workload recognition performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and prediction time. The interindividual differences in term of workload are also identiﬁed and can be accommodated by the proposed framework due to its adaptiveness."
